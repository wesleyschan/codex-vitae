# Codex Vitae - Wesley Chan

I love [Buster Benson's Codex Vitae](https://github.com/busterbenson/public/blob/master/Codex.md). It's his collection of life philosophies, beliefs, and influences in his life that have shaped his thinking. The project also reminded me of how Dad maintains his own massive Word document -- filled with hundreds of pages that contains his thoughts and documentation about household stuff. I've never read through it, I just know it's there and he opens it from time to time.

I thought I'd jump on board, too.

This will be a living document, and something for myself to return to regularly. Would be cool when I get older to see how my younger self was thinking about the world, and how my thoughts and beliefs change throughout a lifetime. I also thought I'd get started and write bit by bit instead of sitting on my buns worrying about perfectionism. Now is not the time to be a weenie!!

## Where am I in life as I write this? 

I am 22. It's now June 2017. I turn 23 in November 2017. It's been a year since I've graduated from college, and three months since I've left the bird's nest at the university design lab. I've jumped into another bird's nest -- my hometown of San Jose -- after years of living in San Diego for school. While I wouldn't say this was exactly as I had planned (my wish would be to say that I have a swanky new job and/or a gradudate school offer), I think it would be good to take this as an opportunity to reflect and grow. Creating this Codex Vitae is one way I hope to accomplish that.

## What matters?


## 1. Beliefs & Philosophies 

- **People are for the most part, inherently good.** Or at the very least, they tend to be reciprocal. And even if they're not, go ahead and treat others and strangers as if they were. Set the standard for cooperation. (Even a nod and smile is enough, at least in American culture. That may be culturally specific). I realize that may be awfully naive, but I think it's everybody's duty to help break the chain when we're all stuck in a cycle of violence or despair. 
- Your body and mind are not separable. The human body is not just a vessel for the mind. 
- **Cynicism is a convenient trap to fall into.** I am not one to talk about this. 
- **Is productivity the only measure of a person's work?** No!! And yet, there's this obsession with it. There's more to work than productivity itself.
- **Righteous anger is a dangerous and intoxicating trap.** I won't pretend that I don't fall for it sometimes.
- **Beware the cult of happiness.** Happiness, at least by the western interpretation of it (being blissful, . I say this as a jolly fellow. To give credence only to this emotion is to  
- **Rights and duties are the different sides of the same coin.** (Eric Liu -- what was the direct quotation again?). 
- Political Views (ooo)

**Beware the false dichotomy.** Those false dichotomies present themselves constantly, just in different shapes during the course of a life. (Think of that internet meme: In school, it's choosing academics, social life, or sleep.) It could mean choosing career or family. Career or love. But it's not always one or the other -- sometimes there's some wiggle room. [chew more on this] ________ . You cannot have everything in life, sure, and the hardest part at times is making a decision. What will you prioritize?

"You and Your Research"

I went to a Catholic high school for four years without being Catholic myself. It was actually quite relaxed -- perhaps even unconventional. Some of my teachers were former Jesuit priests who left the priesthood so they could marry and start a family. [How did that change you? ________] Got exposed to all sorts of different faiths and backgrounds, and I can see where religion serves as an anchor for many people.


During the presidential election in 2016, I learned that some friends were DREAMers.
