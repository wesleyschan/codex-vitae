# Codex Vitae - Wesley Chan

I am inspired by [Buster Benson's Codex Vitae](https://github.com/busterbenson/public/blob/master/Codex.md). It's his collection of life philosophies, beliefs, and influences in his life that have shaped his thinking. The project also reminded me of how Dad maintains his own massive Word document -- filled with hundreds of pages that contains his thoughts and documentation about household stuff. 

Anyways, I thought I'd jump on board, too.

This will be a living document, and something I'll return to regularly. I figured it would be good to get started and write bit by bit instead of worrying about perfection.

## Where am I in life as I write this? 

I am 22. It's been a year since I've graduated from college, and three months since I've left the bird's nest at the university design lab. It's now June 2017. I've jumped into another bird's nest -- my hometown of San Jose -- after years of living in San Diego for school. While I wouldn't say this was exactly as I had planned (my wish would be to say that I have a swanky new job and/or a gradudate school offer), I think it would be good to take this as an opportunity to reflect and grow. Creating this Codex Vitae is one way I hope to accomplish that.
