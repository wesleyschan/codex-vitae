# Codex Vitae - Wesley Chan

I am inspired by [Buster Benson's Codex Vitae](https://github.com/busterbenson/public/blob/master/Codex.md) -- a personal collection of life philosophies, lessons learned, and personal influences. And also by how Dad keeps a massive Word document; his own Master Document that contains his life thoughts and documentation about household stuff. I thought I'd jump on board, too.

This will be a living, breathing document. Rough? Unpolished? Definitely, for now at least. But I'll be returning to this regularly.

## Where am I in life as I write this? 

I am 22. It's been a year since I've graduated from college. And at this very moment (June 2017), I am on the job hunt. I moved back home to San Jose after years of living in San Diego for school. So you could say that I'm in a reflective moment.
