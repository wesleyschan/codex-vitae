# Codex Vitae - Wesley Chan

I was inspired by Buster Benson's bit on the Codex Vitae -- a personal collection of life philosophies, lessons learned, and personal influences. I thought I'd give this a shot, too.

Still working out Markdown and Git though. Is there an unwritten rule to how much you should write before you can commit your changes?
