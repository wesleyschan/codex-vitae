# Codex Vitae - Wesley Chan

I am inspired by [Buster Benson's Codex Vitae](https://github.com/busterbenson/public/blob/master/Codex.md) -- a personal collection of life philosophies, lessons learned, and personal influences. And also by how Dad keeps a massive Word document . I thought I'd jump on board, too.

Side commentary:
Still working out Markdown and Git though. Is there an unwritten rule to how much you should write before you can commit your changes? Like, is it fine to be committing all these rough drafts at once, or should I get it solid before pressing that commit button? Those are surface details anyhow. Let's not worry about that for now, and let's just get started.d

This will be a living, breathing document. I hope to dedicate myself to maintaining and developing this as I go along in life.

## Where am I in life as I write this? 

I am 22. It's been a year since I've graduated from college. And at this very moment (June 2017), I am on the job hunt. I moved back home to San Jose after years of living in San Diego for school. So you could say that I'm in a reflective moment.
