# Codex Vitae - Wesley Chan

I love [Buster Benson's Codex Vitae](https://github.com/busterbenson/public/blob/master/Codex.md). It's his collection of life philosophies, beliefs, and influences in his life that shaped his thinking. The project also reminded me of how Dad maintains his own massive Word document -- filled with hundreds of pages that contains his thoughts and documentation about household stuff. I've never read through it, I just know it's there and he opens it from time to time.

I thought I'd jump on board, too.

This will be a living document, and something for myself to return to regularly. Would be cool when I get older to see how my younger self was thinking about the world, and how my thoughts and beliefs change throughout a lifetime. I also thought I'd get started and write bit by bit instead of sitting on my buns worrying about perfectionism. Now is not the time to be a weenie.

## Where am I in life as I write this? 

I am 22. It's now June 2017. I turn 23 in November 2017. It's been a year since I've graduated from college, and three months since I've left the bird's nest at the university design lab. I've jumped into another bird's nest -- my hometown of San Jose -- after years of living in San Diego for school. While I wouldn't say this was exactly as I had planned (my wish would be to say that I have a swanky new job and/or a gradudate school offer), I think it would be good to take this as an opportunity to reflect and grow. Creating this Codex Vitae is one way I hope to accomplish that.

## What matters?


## 1. Beliefs & Philosophies 

What I believe, and how I try to live that out.

- **People are for the most part, inherently good.** Or at the very least, they tend to be reciprocal. And even if they're not, go ahead and treat others and strangers as if they were. Set the standard for cooperation. (Even a nod and smile is enough, at least in American culture. That may be culturally specific). I realize that may be awfully naive, but I think it's everybody's duty to help break the chain when we're all stuck in a cycle of violence or despair. Lack of cooperation is not reason enough to use force. (Note that this is different from watching someone put another person in grave danger).
- **Your body and mind are not separable.** (or: peace out Cartesian dualism). The human body is not just a vessel for the mind. 
- **Cynicism is a convenient trap to fall into.** I like what Maria Popova writes as her final lesson in "10 Years of Brain Pickings" -- #10: "Don't just resist cynicism, fight it actively." Starting in high school and college, I noticed that humor in those ages tends to have more of a bite. More on tearing things down, as opposed to revealing something. ((Something about it feels unsettling, but why? Will have to think on this some more)). 
- **Is productivity the only measure of a person's work?** No!! And yet, there's this obsession with it. There's more to work than productivity itself.
- **Righteous anger is a dangerous and intoxicating trap.** I won't pretend that I don't fall for it sometimes.
- **Beware the cult of happiness.** Happiness, at least by the western interpretation of it (being blissful, . I say this as a jolly fellow. To give credence only to this emotion is to  
- **Rights and duties are the different sides of the same coin.** (Eric Liu -- what was the direct quotation again?). 
- Political Views (ooo)

**Beware false dichotomies in everyday life, and *especially* with the bigger decisions.** Those false dichotomies present themselves constantly, just in different shapes during the course of a life. (Think of that internet meme: In school, it's choosing academics, social life, or sleep.) It could mean choosing career or family. Career or love. But it's not always one or the other -- sometimes there's some wiggle room. [chew more on this] ________ . You cannot have everything in life, sure, and the hardest part at times is making a decision. What will you prioritize?

"You and Your Research" by Richard Hamming: http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html

I went to a Catholic high school for four years without being Catholic myself. It was actually quite relaxed -- perhaps even unconventional. Some of my teachers were former Jesuit priests who left the priesthood so they could marry and start a family. [How did that change you? ________] Got exposed to all sorts of different faiths and backgrounds, and I can see where religion serves as an anchor for many people.

Places to stretch:

## Wake-up calls (or: rude awakenings)
- The 2016 American presidential election (yikes), and how one close friend almost seemed gleeful about it. Not because he supported the winner of the election, he just wanted to watch the world burn. I learned that taking a detached approach to everything is not the way to go; feigning ignorance or indifference towards what is happening in the world or to people in the community is something I have less patience for nowadays. [explain why]. 
- Getting rejected by all the PhD programs I applied to. Now that I think of it, it's a good thing that I was. (I don't think I was ready). But that does mean I need to keep moving forward and deciding next steps.

## On Running

I like running (or more accurately, I like having done it). It's calming after the first 20 or 30 minutes. And then I go up and down in terms of how I feel about it throughout the course of the run. 

On marathons: if you can run a half-marathon, then you can run a full marathon, 100%. I'm biased, but I think everybody should try it at least once in their lifetime, provided your joints are healthy. 

(What about that Bojack Horseman clip, with how in running, it gets easier every day you do it. It's just that running every day is the hard part).
