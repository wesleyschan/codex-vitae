# Codex Vitae - Wesley Chan

I love [Buster Benson's Codex Vitae](https://github.com/busterbenson/public/blob/master/Codex.md). It's his collection of beliefs, philosophies, and influences in his life that shaped his thinking. Dad maintains his own massive Word document, filled with hundreds of pages that contains his thoughts and records about life and household stuff. I've never read through it, I just know it's there and he opens it from time to time.

So I thought I'd jump on board, too.

Motivation: Would be cool when I get older to see how my younger self was thinking about the world, and how my thoughts and beliefs change throughout a lifetime. I also thought I'd practice the art of starting and writing bit by bit instead of sitting on my buns worrying about perfectionism.

Other inspirations: Ray Dalio's Principles, ____, 

## Where am I in life as I write this? 

I am 22. I started this in June 2017. I turn 23 in November 2017. It's been a year since I've graduated from college, and three months since I've left the bird's nest at the university design lab. I've jumped into another bird's nest: my hometown of San Jose, years after living in San Diego for school. While I wouldn't say this was exactly as I had planned (my wish would be to say that I have a swanky new job and/or a graduate school offer), I think it's best I take this as an opportunity to reflect and grow. Creating this Codex Vitae is one way I hope to accomplish that.

At least I have a roof over my head, food to eat, and loving family and friends. Hard to ask for more. (Okay, meaningful work would be good, but that's something I'll have to actively craft -- it certainly won't be handed down to me).

## What matters?
Connection. That goes with human relationships. A dear friend of mine must jump into every pool of water she sees. Any river, she'll jump in. She even jumped into the canals in Utrecht, clothes still on and everything. I thought she was nuts, but I was also a bit envious. Since when did someone get so much joy from jumping into the water? She'd invite other people to do the same.


## 1. Beliefs & Philosophies 

What I believe, and how I try to live that out.

- Nature *and* Nurture. I am a product of my environment, my friends, my family, my experiences and how I choose to interpret them. Phrasing it that way also means that it's never too late to change. Few mistakes in life are non-reversible.

- Personality tests are fun, but I try not to put too much weight into them. Still though, don't a lot of people enjoy being told something about themselves? Here's a more interesting question: instead of debating their validity at the next party, why not ask the other person about their results? Do they feel it's an accurate representation of them? Why or why not?

- **People are for the most part, inherently good.** And even if they're not, go ahead and treat others as if they were. Set the standard for cooperation. If people are not inherently good, then at least they are reciprocal. Sometimes I wonder if I am being naive, but I also think that this is an effective belief to break the chain when we're all stuck in a cycle of violence or despair. Assuming that other people mean well (within reason) shifts your own unconscious behaviors and how you treat others. While this lack of discretion may not work so well in a war zone or rough neighborhood, but the underlying principle is the same. Trust people, even if it puts you at risk of being hurt from time to time.
- **Your body and mind are intertwined.** One affects the other (goodbye Cartesian dualism). I am skeptical of when people say they want to upload their entire minds on the Internet. It makes for great cinema and storytelling (e.g. see: the original animated "Ghost in the Shell" movie, not the recent live-action one), but I don't think that is the reality we live in. Much of what we learn in the world is tied to our bodies and senses.
- **Cynicism is a convenient trap to fall into.** I like what Maria Popova writes as her final lesson in "10 Years of Brain Pickings" -- #10: "Don't just resist cynicism, fight it actively." Starting in high school and college, I noticed that humor in those ages tends to have more of a bite. More on tearing things down, as opposed to revealing something. ((Something about it feels unsettling, but why? Will have to think on this some more)). 
- **Productivity is not the only measure of someone's work contribution.** There's an obsession with productivity metrics, especially in Silicon Valley or "knowledge work". Human beings are not machines, and I don't think it does us any favors when we compare our output the same way a machine would. Productivity says nothing of the creativity that human beings may have.
- **Righteous anger is a dangerous and intoxicating trap.** Similar to self-righteousness or vigilantism. Makes for good storytelling, but I can't think of any situation where it didn't get me into huge trouble. I won't pretend that I don't fall for it sometimes.
- **Beware the cult of happiness.** Happiness, at least by the western interpretation of it (being blissful, . I say this as a jolly fellow. To give credence only to this emotion is to refuse the other emotions the dignity they deserve. And just in general, a lot of men (I think this is mostly due to culture) seem to have taken pride in not showing emotions. That's not strong, that's called being a psychopath.
- **Rights and duties are the different sides of the same coin.** (Eric Liu -- what was the direct quotation again?). 
- Political Views (ooo)

**Beware false dichotomies in everyday life, and *especially* with the bigger decisions.** In school, it's choosing academics, social life, or sleep. In adult life, it could mean choosing career or family. Career or love. Move to your dream city, but abandon your family. Stay at your hometown, but be miserable. But it's not always one or the other -- there's often wiggle room in what you choose to do. You cannot have everything in life, sure, and the hardest part at times is making a decision. What is your priority?

Make time for pockets of stillness. Buster Benson calls this "wiggle room". 

## Responsibilities, Duties

- **Leave the world a better place than when you found it.** Everyday situations: you're at the workplace, and you see a mess in the kitchen or tables. Even if you didn't make the mess, go ahead and clean it up anyway, or do a little part of it. It doesn't take much time for you to do that. I remember watching a friend we I'm still working on this. I've heard this from the professors I used to work with in the design lab.
- **Beter een goede buur dan een verre vriend.** Better a good neighbor than a distant friend.


## Observations on where I fall short -- at least for now.

- **Righteous anger.** Bullies infuriate me. But not all scuffles are worth it, and the older I get, the more I risk losing. Is it all worth it? Before intervening, ask myself: am I intervening because of my ego, or because it's the right thing to do? What do I hope to solve?
- **I am my worst enemy.** I've always been drawn to people who are more critical of themselves than of other people. Being able to look at yourself objectively and assess your strengths and shortcomings is so important for growth as a human being. But it's different when you start beating yourself up all the time for your mistakes.

Aaron Swartz, "Raw Thought"

Paul Graham's Essays



I went to a Catholic high school for four years without being Catholic myself. It was actually quite relaxed -- perhaps even unconventional. Some of my teachers were former Jesuit priests who left the priesthood so they could marry and start a family. [How did that change you? ________] Got exposed to all sorts of different faiths and backgrounds, and I can see where religion serves as an anchor for many people.

## Wake-up calls (or: rude awakenings)
- The 2016 American presidential election (yikes), and how one close friend seemed gleeful about it. Not because he supported the winner of the election, he just wanted to watch the world burn. I learned that taking a detached approach to everything is not the way to go -- not if you want to help make the world a better place; feigning ignorance or indifference towards what is happening in the world or to people in the community is something I have less patience for nowadays. [explain why]. 
- Getting kicked out by the landlord two hours within moving in -- an argument about concentration camps and the rights of minorities turned sour. (He was a white supremacist, and I found that out too late). I became homeless for a day (it was already 11 PM by the time I got kicked out) and slept in the lab, only to get rescued by my boss and her family. Actually, her mother.
- Getting rejected by all the PhD programs I applied to. It's a good thing I did, because I was diving head-first into an academic research career without properly thinking about the implications. I was moving forward and it sounded cool, so why not keep charging forward?
- Getting rejected by just about all the jobs I am applying to. Even with being a busser (the person who cleans up the dirty dishes and floor and prepares the tables for the next guests) in the dumpling house, that took a lot of time.

## On Running

I like running -- or more accurately, I like having done it. It's calming after the first 20 or 30 minutes. And then I go up and down in terms of how I feel about it throughout the course of the run. 

On marathons: if you can run a half-marathon, then you can run a full marathon, 100%. I'm biased, but I think everybody should try it at least once in their lifetime, provided your joints are healthy. 

There's a clip from the end of Bojack Horseman's second season that I enjoy, about how in running, it gets easier every day you do it. It's just that running every day is the hard part. **[note to self: find that clip]** 

## On Writing
Like running, I sometimes prefer having done it than the act of doing it. But that's not entirely true, I do find great pleasure in writing. Or at least gratitude with it. Writing helps turn my thoughts into something I can reflect on, and I can mold and shape it however I wish. Writing down my thoughts also forces me to hold myself accountable for closing open loops in my thinking. Or recognizing that my thinking was a bunch of B.S. in the first place.

## On Research
I dove head-first into an academic research career after graduating from college. And then I got rejected by all the grad schools I applied to. Looking back, it's a good thing I was, because I was too green anyway. I could use more time out of the oven.

## On Expectations
I used to live with someone who said that "everybody is stupid". Of course, everybody except him. What a safe way of looking at the world -- now you'll never have to challenge yourself. Some may say that if you don't expect much from life or from other people, you'll never be disappointed. Okay sure, but such an attitude prevents you from building trust and building authentic relationships with other people.

And when I think of the mentor-student / sensei-padawan relationships I've had in the past, almost all of them dared / expected me to do something that I didn't think was possible for myself. Holding people to higher standards and expectations can challenge them to 

## Stay on high alert for these attitudes:
- **"I just want to watch the world burn."** Given how the other person saying that lives in the same world, I found that statement a bit odd. 
- **"I'm just trolling, haha, don't take it so seriously."** I think I can take a joke, but I've also noticed that many trolls in real life who try to provoke reactions from public audiences are usually being sincere, just under the guise of the troll -- at least until they meet someone else who tries to do the same thing or holds the same beliefs. 
- **"Being jealous just means I care, right?"** I've seen this happen in relationships, where one out of the two people will say that phrase. And I mean, yikes. Isn't that controlling behavior?


## On blossoming.
I have a lot of growing to do, and I'd like to think I'm one of those "late-bloomers". Sometimes I wonder if things take longer for me to recognize or to encode in my brain. This goes for socializing, thinking, doing anything, taking care of myself, going on dates, that kind of thing. 



## Reflecting on other people's life advice to me.
- Being young is the time to take risks. Not taking risks now will lead to greater risks in the future. 
- Be careful with your own narrative. Don't believe it when people tell you who you are, but believe it when others say who they are. (Maria Popova?)


## Retrospective futurism.


> Tools for Thought is an exercise in retrospective futurism; that is, I wrote it in the early 1980s, attempting to look at what the mid 1990s would be like. My odyssey started when I discovered Xerox PARC and Doug Engelbart and realized that all the journalists who had descended upon Silicon Valley were missing the real story. Yes, the tales of teenagers inventing new industries in their garages were good stories. But the idea of the personal computer did not spring full-blown from the mind of Steve Jobs. Indeed, the idea that people could use computers to amplify thought and communication, as tools for intellectual work and social activity, was not an invention of the mainstream computer industry nor orthodox computer science, nor even homebrew computerists. If it wasn't for people like J.C.R. Licklider, Doug Engelbart, Bob Taylor, Alan Kay, it wouldn't have happened. But their work was rooted in older, equally eccentric, equally visionary, work, so I went back to piece together how Boole and Babbage and Turing and von Neumann -- especially von Neumann - created the foundations that the later toolbuilders stood upon to create the future we live in today. You can't understand where mind-amplifying technology is going unless you understand where it came from.

[*Tools for Thought*, by Howard Rheingold](http://www.rheingold.com/texts/tft/). Fascinating account of the history of human-computer interaction.


## On "cross-pollinating".

I got that term from Maria Popova. It's the notion of pulling insights and wisdom from multiple disciplines and drawing from multiple disciplines into one -- drawing from multiple disciplines to make sense of the world.



## Thoughts I haven't sorted out yet.

#### 3. Ways of moving about in the world.

- Establishing roots; combining both 
- Keeping in touch with old friends and family
- Findings ways to get outside of the head.

#### 4. Litmus tests, or questions to ask myself, or others.

- When spending time with someone, ask: "Is this the kind of person I'd want to have breakfast with?". And flip the question around to yourself, too: "Am I someone other people would want to have breakfast with?"
- When thinking of revenge, ask: "Is this the kind of person I want to be?"
- Who do you have inside your inner council? (Idea from Eric Greitens). It can be anyone dead or alive, historical or not. Imagine them as coaches or mentors you can return to in your imagination. It could be someone you know personally, or anybody else. 


#### 6. What I need to keep reminding myself. (Or: lessons I keep having to relearn). 

- An obsession with fairness can lead to your premature demise. What I mean by that is ____.
- Every person you meet is an opportunity to learn.
- Freedom is not only defined by the absence of coercion or duties. (Or: why I got annoyed with abstract libertarian ideologies after months of being dazzled by them, and years of flirting).

#### 7. Healthy habits.

- On running.
- On freewriting.
